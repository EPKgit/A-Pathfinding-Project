Lesssons Learned:
- A* Pathfinding
	- System used to navigate the grid
	- Generally used in systems involving Euclidian distance, as it makes calculating distances between nodes easier
	- Chooses next node to process based on distance from start and to end
- General graph theory
	- Vertices
	- Weighted vs Unweighted
	- Edges
	- Traversal strategies
		- Dijkstra
		- Bredth/Width first
- Proposals
	- Interesting experience in learning how to effectively communicate software ideas
	- Had to submit a proposal and pitch to get approved
- Shared_ptr 
	- Useful in keeping track of dynamic objects
	- Dynamically declared objects are able to be shared in contrast to unique_ptr
	- Prevents memory leaks due to undeleted objects
